## About
The [packLDrawModel utility](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/utils/packLDrawModel.mjs) from the [three.js repository](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git) is used to statically link an LDraw model's part file dependencies into one file for optimal rendering via THREE's [https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/master/examples/jsm/loaders/LDrawLoader.js](LDrawLoader). This repo's packLDrawModel.mjs modifies the original utility to handle non-standard Bricklink printed part IDs from [stud.io LDraw](https://studiohelp.bricklink.com/hc/en-us/articles/6502197862679-Exporting-to-other-formats#h_01HW3KG3E7E8ZC077CTYTX25E1) exports by finding equivalent LDraw IDs provided through the [Rebrickable API](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://rebrickable.com/api/&ved=2ahUKEwjvy5DYhZeKAxVx6ckDHRp4Il0QFnoECA4QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2s1Dcz3neOmEAiGQsZHxYV).
